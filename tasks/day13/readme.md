Part 2 was not solved without help - I made a bruteforce solution, which was simply not efficient (I even let it run while i was away for 10min and it did not finish). In the end, I looked for tips and found someone explaining how you can find the solution in the same approach I was taking, it was just safe to increment the step by more than the largest element bus ID on the list (which was my initial solution).
Instead of making it adapt to non-prime lists, I just added a check.
